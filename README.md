# skill-demo
- A demonstration of skills with React.js/Asp.net/Fastify.js
- NOTE: this project is for demonstration purposes only and does not reflect 
  the projects that I've worked with in the past 8 years since
  the code bases are almost always in a private repository and can only be
  accessed via vpn. I'm also not allowed to share the code base since 
  I'm under non disclosure agreement when i sign the working contract.
